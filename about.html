            <h4> HISTORY OF THE<br> SCHOOL</h4>
      
            <div class="history__section1">
                <p>
                    The thought of starting Kanjuri High School as a harambee (self-help) secondary school
                    was conceived by the community around the school at the dawn of Kenya’s independence in 1963.
                    The school opened its doors to the first group of Form 1 students on Monday, 11th May 1964,
                    using the facilities of the hitherto Kanjuri Intermediate School.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    The school is located at the old site of Kanjuri Primary School which moved to its current site
                    after the establishment of the secondary school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Responding to the desire by the community to start the school, a group of 17 visionary and
                    far sighted elders, in a rare spirit of selflessness and self-sacrifice, offered their land title
                    deeds as collateral in order to raise the initial seed fund to fulfil the laid down Government
                    requirements for registration of the school.
                </p>

                      <div class="history__section1">
                        <p>
                            This spirit of selflessness and self-sacrifice by all the school’s stakeholders has been the
                            primary driving force of the school throughout its history. The school has always been a jewel
                            of excellence and source of pride to all its stakeholders and the community.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The name Kanjuri is derived from a popular traditional dance of the earlier days called ‘Njuuri’
                            which was performed in the proximity of the school, prior to the establishment of Kanjuri Primary School.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On establishment of Kanjuri High School, a new form of dance of excellence in education was
                            substituted for the earlier traditional dance.
